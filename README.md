## About the Project
> **Disclaimer**: I do not encourage the practice the practice of web scraping since some sites may have their own terms and regulation regarding web scraping. This project is only for educational purpose, not for commercial :v:

**_Mau Makan Di Mana_** is my portfolio project to demonstrate my skill in collecting, processing and turning data into insights. In this project, the data is collected through web scraping method on Zomato website to get all restaurant information in Jakarta listed on Zomato system. The project currently has finished collecting the data and doing simple EDA (Exploratoty Data Analysis). This project will be further improved by adding more EDA, creating simple recommendation system and creating Tableau dashboard as well. Wish me luck! :raised_hands:
